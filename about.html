<main> <p> Vegan Heaven is a family owned restaraunt that has been arond since 2017. Our restaraunt strives on provding nutritional food and advice about veganism to our customers. Our Main priority is to provide the best experience we can to our customers.</p>
<p> The reasoning behind the creation of our restaraunt is our family has a history of high blood pressure. Doctors told my mother that since her mother had it, more than likely she will suffer from it. Our family did not like that information, and started researching about the American diet. We found information that links our diet to health problems American suffer from. Switching to Veganism has prevent my mother from having high blood pressure, and she is feeling better than ever. We hope to pass on the useful information we discovered to our customers. </p><br/>
